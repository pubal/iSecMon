Android Application for Internet Threat Monitoring

In order to learn a little about mobile application development, I’ve starting creating an app to help monitor Internet threat levels. I’m going to start by pulling in and displaying the current threat rating of security companies and government agencies such as the SANS Infocon and IBM’s Alertcon. Then, I want to monitor them for changes so the app can generate a notification. Finally, I think the ability to pull in RSS feeds from said companies so the user can see why the threat level has changed would be useful.

Right now, I’m just displaying the current SANS Infocon and linking to the Internet Storm Center.

This is available in the Google Play Store. As I have time, I’ll be adding the additional functionality I mentioned.
